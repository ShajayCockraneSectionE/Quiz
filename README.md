# Quiz
This assignment was to create a simple interactive quiz using Javascript,HTML and CSS. I created a simple quiz based on Geography where I can login using a fake username and password, if any of these are incorrect, an error message will pop up. Once you log in correctly it takes you to the quiz. The quiz has an question counter which shows you where you are at out of the total number of questions. Once finished it will display you score and ask if you want to play again.

I created the HTML which basically shows how the layout of the webpage(what subject the quiz is centered around, the questions structure and the next button). I used the Javascript to create the questions, calculate the score,show whether answers are correct or incorrect, show the score at the end of the quiz and request the user to play again and the question counter.

I did face some challenges while doing this project. Firstly, I created the questions in the Javascript instead of using the forms in HTML structure, I found this much easier personally. Secondly, when trying to create the progress bar, I wasn't able to get the bar to increase as the next button is pressed in the Javascript so I switch to the question counter which was easier to understand.
